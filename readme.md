# Opensource Defrag
Opensource Defrag is a project that aims to remake defrag, true to the original mod, using modern id-Tech3 engine and technology.  

## Goals
### Improvement & Modernizing
By using id-Tech3 engine, gameplay can stay true to the original.  
But, by using modern tools and technology, the game can be modernized and extended beyond its current limitations.  
See the [Roadmap](https://github.com/OpensourceQuake3/defrag/milestones?direction=asc&sort=title&state=open) for an overview of the project's future.  

### Gameplay
- Maintain gameplay 1:1.
- Achieve compatibility with existing maps. Avoid requiring map porting for existing content.
- Community collaboration in bug-fixing and further development of the mod.

### Code & License
- Respect FOSS philosophy. Open source and community focus.
- Eliminate q3a-sdk licensing constraints.
- Ensure that rewritten code is 1:1 compatible/accurate to defrag
- Community based, where anyone can become a contributor.

### Opensource commitment
This project will always remain opensourced.  
To help in preservation of this freedom:  
- All users will have their own local copy of the source code  
- This copy will always be distributed inside the mod's distribution files  
This enforces openness, by giving the community power to control the source-code, just like GPL does.

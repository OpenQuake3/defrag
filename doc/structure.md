## src/game/sgame/phy
Contains all code related to the movement physics.  
All of this code happens inside a single `Pmove()` instance, and starts with `phy_PmoveSingle()` inside `bg_pmove.c`.  
This is very different to every other defrag mod, that has all of the physics integrated into one single code flow.  

This change started to preserve vq3 and cpm from being affected by bugs in the new physics, but turned out to be extremely useful for the other physics too, because they make the code much cleaner to navigate, and much easier to reason about.  
Instead of having some gigantic functions full of edge cases that don't apply to what you are looking for, you just follow the code into the correct function and read whats in front of you.  

The goal of this `Pmove()` hook is to move the code flow completely outside of the `bg_pmove.c` file, which was already 2500 lines before adding any defrag specific code, and really hard to navigate.   
_(to give some perspective: At some point, the file got up to 5k lines, and that was early dev with just cpm/vq3)_

Each physics has its own separate flow, and should be kept separate to ensure that bugs don't bleed from one physics into the other.  
Each of those flows are also kept in their own separate files, unless they use the exact same code from other files. In which case they just call for those functions instead.  
See `*/phy/vq1.c` or `*/phy/vq4.c` for codeflow examples that are completely different to q3a in almost every function  
See `*/phy/vjk.c` for a codeflow that follows q3a almost entirely, except for a couple of exceptions

## src/game/ui Subfolders
Contains code related to the new ui framework.  
It is currently compiled on demand, and not included by default.  

The structure tries to modularize the framework, within the limitations of C.  
As such, C code files are stored in subfolders named `*/c/`, while their roots contain a header file for each of the "modules" contained within that `*/c/` subfolder.

This results in structures like:
```
Folder with two modules:   main and callbacks
*/ui/c/main.c       <--- UI Main implementation
*/ui/c/callbacks.c  <--- Callback implementation
*/ui/main.h         <--- Declarations of methods accesible from outside main.c
*/ui/callbacks.h    <--- Declarations of methods accessible from outside callbacks.c

Folder with one module:   elements
*/ui/framework/c/action.c    <-- Action element implementation code
*/ui/framework/c/cursor.c    <-- Cursor element implementation code
*/ui/framework/c/radiobtn.c  <-- Radio Button element implementation code
*/ui/framework/elements.h    <-- Declarations of accesible methods for all elements
```
